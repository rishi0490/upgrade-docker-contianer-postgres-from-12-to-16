Upgrade postgres-16 of metabase container in a specific network that you have already created, you just need to add the --network flag to your docker run command. Here is the updated command:
bash

create first docker containter with empty dir
Copy code
docker run -d \
  --name postgres-16 \
  --network <your_prod_network> \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=mese \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="^f" \
  -v /home/ubuntu/mount/postgres/16/new_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  postgres:16
Make sure to replace <your_prod_network> with the name of your production Docker network.


docker exec -t <postgres12_container_name_or_id> pg_dumpall -U metabase > pg_backup_latest.sql


To take a PostgreSQL backup using the pg_dumpall command from inside a Docker container, your command is almost correct. Here's a refined version:
bash
Copy code
docker exec -t <postgres12_container_name_or_id> pg_dumpall -U metabase -c > pg_backup_latest.sql
The -c flag is often useful because it adds DROP statements before each table, ensuring you can restore without conflicts.
Replace <postgres12_container_name_or_id> with the actual container name or ID of your PostgreSQL 12 container. This will create the pg_backup_latest.sql file in the current working directory on your local machine.




docker cp /home/ubuntu/mount/postgres/16/pg_backup_latest.sql postgres-16:/pg_backup.sql\n


The correct command to copy a file from your local machine to a Docker container would be:
bash
Copy code
docker cp /home/ubuntu/mount/postgres/16/pg_backup_latest.sql postgres-16:/pg_backup.sql
This will copy the pg_backup_latest.sql file from your local directory to the /pg_backup.sql path inside the postgres-16 container. No changes are necessary to the command you've provided.




update these steps accordingly * Copy the backup file to the new PostgreSQL 16 container:bash Copy code   docker cp pg_backup.sql postgres-16:/pg_backup.sql *   Enter the running PostgreSQL 16 container: * You need to run the command from within the Docker container, not on your host machine. * To get a shell inside the container: * bash * Copy code * docker exec -it postgres-16 bash * This command will open an interactive shell inside the postgres-16 container. * 2. Run the psql restore command: * Once inside the container, you can now restore the backup file with the following command: * bash * Copy code * psql -U metabase -d postgres -f /pg_backup.sql * This will execute the SQL commands from the pg_backup.sql file and restore the database. * 3. Verify the restoration: * After the restoration is complete, verify that the data has been restored by connecting to the database: * bash * Copy code * psql -U metabase -d postgres * You can then run SQL queries to confirm the data is restored.



Here are the updated steps with some refinements to match the scenario and streamline the instructions:
1. Copy the backup file to the PostgreSQL 16 container: bash Copy code   docker cp /home/ubuntu/mount/postgres/16/pg_backup_latest.sql postgres-16:/pg_backup.sql
2.   
3. Enter the running PostgreSQL 16 container: To access a shell inside the postgres-16 container: bash Copy code   docker exec -it postgres-16 bash
4.    This command opens an interactive shell inside the postgres-16 container.
5. Run the psql restore command: Once inside the container, restore the backup file with: bash Copy code   psql -U metabase -d postgres -f /pg_backup.sql
6.    This command will execute the SQL statements from the pg_backup.sql file and restore the database.
7. Verify the restoration: After the restoration is complete, verify that the data is restored by connecting to the database: bash Copy code   psql -U metabase -d postgres
8.    You can now run SQL queries inside the PostgreSQL shell to confirm that the data is restored as expected.

apt install vim Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree... Done Reading state information... Done E: Unable to locate package vim



If you're seeing the error E: Unable to locate package vim, it typically means that the package index on your system is outdated or the vim package isn't available in your current sources. You can resolve this by following these steps:
1. Update the package list: Run the following command to update your package lists: bash Copy code   sudo apt update
2.   
3. Install Vim: After updating the package lists, you should be able to install vim with: bash Copy code   sudo apt install vim
4.   
If you still encounter issues after updating, it might be due to the sources in your /etc/apt/sources.list. You can open that file to verify that it contains the correct repositories for your Ubuntu or Debian version.
